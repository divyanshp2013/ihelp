We incessantly endeavour to employ creative learning methods to infuse impressionable young minds with curiosity and excitement as these first generation pupils take their unprecedented steps in embarking upon a journey that will lead to their liberation and our contentment. 
                        <p align="justify">We supplement their classroom sessions with creative educational and extracurricular activities at the IIM campus to equip them to think out of the box and facilitate their smooth absorption into the mainstream core.

It’s with this spirit that we associate with various schools and NGOs to assist them with resourceful manpower which has a background from all three streams (Science, Commerce & Arts) to educate, motivate and inculcate the desire to study among those who have been unfortunate enough not to reap the benefits of education. Our primary cause is education of underprivileged children, since we believe that education is the key to overall development of an individual

I started my journey at IIM Indore to be a successful manager because it was my dream. But between the hectic schedule of college; visiting schools, teaching and playing with kids helped me realised that I can act as a channel to fulfill dreams of underprivileged kids. With this in mind, Initially, I joined i-Help as an Acad member, from a member to media co-coordinator, and now overall coordinator of i-Help; I have collected some priceless memories.  i-Help as a team has always worked hard to raise funds and make every possible effort for organizing events for these kids, buying them books and what not. We have been successful in making teaching and learning fascinating by use of tablets and laptops and have come a long way ahead from where we started. 
This year I hope that we bring more smiles and a more significant impact in lives of kids we teach, by scaling up our reach.
